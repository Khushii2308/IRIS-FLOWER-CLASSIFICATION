# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal dimensions. The goal is to develop a highly accurate model that identifies the correct species while analyzing the significance of each feature.

##  Features
âœ” Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes features, and encodes categorical labels.

âœ” Feature Engineering: Identifies the most significant features contributing to classification.

âœ” Machine Learning Model: Implements multiple classifiers, including Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression.

âœ” Performance Evaluation: Uses Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and Accuracy Score for assessment.

âœ” Data Visualization: Includes feature correlations, class distributions, and decision boundary visualizations.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Iris Flower Dataset" from Kaggle. It includes 150 records of Iris flowers, each with sepal and petal dimensions and a corresponding species label.

### ðŸ”— Dataset Link: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

### Features

### Target Variable (Species):
0 â†’ Iris-setosa

1 â†’ Iris-versicolor

2 â†’ Iris-virginica

##  Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git

cd iris-flower-classification


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Class Distribution: Analyzing the number of samples per species.
 
2. Feature Correlation: Understanding relationships between petal/sepal dimensions.
   
3. Pairplot Visualization: Identifying separability of classes through feature distributions.
   
## Model Training & Evaluation

### Preprocessing Steps:
âœ… Feature Scaling â†’ Standardized using StandardScaler.

âœ… Label Encoding â†’ Species labels converted to numeric values (0, 1, 2).

### Models Implemented:
âœ… Logistic Regression
âœ… Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics:
1. Accuracy Score
2. Confusion Matrix
3. Precision, Recall, and F1-score

 ## Usage

### Train the Model
Run the following command to train the model:

python train.py

### Make Predictions
To classify a new flower based on its dimensions, run:

python predict.py --sepal_length 5.1 --sepal_width 3.5 --petal_length 1.4 --petal_width 0.2

### Example Output:

Predicted Species: Iris-setosa[0]

## Model Evaluation Metrics

1. onfusion Matrix: Visualizes classification performance across species.
2. Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each species.
3. Feature Importance: Identifies the most influential features in classification.
   
## Data Visualization
1. Pairplot of Features - Shows how features vary among species.
2. Feature Correlation Heatmap - Highlights feature relationships.
3. Decision Boundaries - Visual representation of classification results.

##  Deployment
This classification model can be deployed using:
âœ… Flask/FastAPI to create an API for real-time predictions.

âœ… Streamlit for an interactive web-based interface.
